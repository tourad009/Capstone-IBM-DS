# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction  
_Capstone Project – IBM Data Science Professional Certificate_

## 📌 Objective  
The goal of this project is to predict whether the **first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket** will successfully land, aiming to support cost-efficient space launches.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
- **Data Collection**: Retrieved using SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted to understand key features affecting landing outcomes.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created static and interactive visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium and Plotly.  
- **Dashboard Development**: Built an interactive dashboard using **Plotly Dash** to monitor mission metrics and landing performance.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to estimate landing success.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium
- Scikit-learn  
- Dash by Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Outcomes  
- Developed a machine learning model to predict landing success.  
- Delivered an interactive dashboard for visual exploration and decision support.
